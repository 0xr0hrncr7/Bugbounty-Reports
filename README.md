# 🐞 My Bug Bounty Write-ups & Responsible Disclosures

## Welcome to my little corner of the internet — a place where I document every bug bounty I work on.

Whether it's a critical vulnerability or a duplicate report, I share:
- What I found  
- How I approached it  
- What tools I used  
- Challenges I faced  
- And what I learned in the process

## ✨ Why This Repo Exists

As an **aspiring security engineer**, this repo is part of my journey in web application security and ethical hacking.

Each folder contains:
- A write-up for a specific program 
- Screenshots, PoCs, notes
- A full breakdown in simple language — no gatekeeping here!
